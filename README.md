Actually nothing especially,but the best version of run is on windows. we run this code on both. There are some little point that I mention if you find any problem try them.
- 1: change the name of file with full address.
- 2: comment second space_to_underline function and uncomment the other one exist above that.
- 3: comment first get_localtime function and uncomment second one.
